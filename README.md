# Challenge -11
## Note Taker

- For the eleventh challenge of my bootcamp, I am tasked with creating a working application that takes in user submitting notes and saves it. I will be using express.js and the working knowledge of back end server development that I have experienced up to this point.

## User Story
---

- AS A small business owner
- I WANT to be able to write and save notes
- SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

GIVEN a note-taking application
> WHEN I open the Note Taker

> WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
> WHEN I click on the Save icon
- THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

## Weekly Reflection
---
This week was incredibly interesting but confusing at the same time. Handling all the new jargon and understanding exactly what express.js was and communicating between server and client side was a lot to take in. I think unlike last week, I have a better grasp of the small scope presented to us currently, but I am still researching and learning as most as I can nonetheless. Node has simply opened a door of confusion and intrigue and I'm excited to continue learning more about the back-end! Lastly, this week marks the halfway point of my journey! Here's to another week!
