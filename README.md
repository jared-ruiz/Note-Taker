# Challenge -11
## Note Taker

- For the eleventh challenge of my bootcamp, I am tasked with creating a working application that takes in user submitting notes and saves it. I will be using express.js and the working knowledge of back end server development that I have experienced up to this point.

<br>
<br>

## User Story
---

- AS A small business owner
- I WANT to be able to write and save notes
- SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Criteria to be considered complete (Apr. 2022)

GIVEN a note-taking application
> WHEN I open the Note Taker
- THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
> WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
- THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
> WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
> WHEN I click on the Save icon
- THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
> WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
- THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
> WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
- THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
